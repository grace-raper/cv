## üë©‚Äçüéì Education

**B.S. in Computer Science** @ [The University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu) _(September 2019 - March 2022)_

Graduated in March 2022 with a B.S. in Computer Science: Data Science and a minor in Applied Mathematics.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Engineering Experience

**COO / Lead Software Engineer** @ [Ghost Pacer](https://www.ghostpacer.com) _(March 2021 - Present)_ <br>

Ghost Pacer is a Techstars-backed company that ran one of the most sucessful crownfunding campaigned in history (top 1%) for custom augmented reality glasses uniquely suited for outdoor and active applications. 

As Chief Operating Officer, played an active role in setting company goals and direction, which included engaging with investors, facilitating meetings with external partners, and managing the hiring and onboarding process for new employees. As Lead Software Engineer, I used Agile principles to managed a team of developers in the design, development, and testing of multiple software releases for Ghost Pacer's custom AR headset, continually incorporating user feedback to deliver high-quality features with easy usability.

A few contributions I would like to highlight include: 

* developed and optimize a Golang application that handled a variety of tasks and was designed to run on our embedded system. To accomplish this, I leveraged several different tools and techniques, including profiling, testing, and debugging tools, as well as a variety of third-party libraries and frameworks. 3D math/linear algebra fundamentals.
* I designed and implemented a GPS positioning algorithm that accurately determined the user's position using data from a variety of different sources. This involved working closely with the hardware team to ensure that our GPS module was functioning correctly, as well as integrating the algorithm with our existing software architecture.
* I integrated a consistent BLE communication protocol between our iOS and watchOS applications to leverage insights from CoreLocation and HealthKit (e.g. user heart rate, sleep statistics, walking cadence, etc). This involved developing custom data protocols to ensure information was being transmitted quickly and correctly. 
* I conducted data analysis of IMU data to determine user behavior and inform our development decisions. This involved using a variety of different tools, including Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas, as well as custom scripts that I developed specifically for this purpose.
* streamlined the UI design to allow for our custom 3d graphics engine to run at a consistent 60 fps on our embedded platform allowing for a smooth and seemless user experience. This involved using DCC tools (e.g. Blender, Photoshop, Illustrator) to create graphical components that were functional and visually appealing.
* I oversaw the integration of Bluetooth audio functionality into our app, which allowed users to stream music and other audio content directly to their Ghost Pacer glasses.
* Finally, I implemented a live user metrics system that allowed users to track their performance and progress in real-time. This involved developing custom data visualization tools and integrating them with our existing software architecture to provide users with accurate, up-to-date information about their workouts and training sessions.
* Employed Git and GitHub to promote collaborate, high-quality, and well-documented code through the implementation of shared style guides, rigorous pull request reviews, and effective branch management and code merging techniques.

**Software Development Intern** @ [Unify Square](https://www.unifysquare.com) _(June 2019 ‚Äî September 2019)_
* Worked with REST APIs to organize, interpret, and compare basic user information across multiple workplace communication platforms, including Zoom, Teams, Slack, and Facebook for Workplace.
* Used popular data analysis tools, such as Python, R, and SQL databases, to clean and analyze data, uncovering key insights that informed strategic decision-making.
* Developed Power BI dashboards and presented findings to C-level executives, providing valuable visualizations of complex data sets.

## üë©‚Äçüîß Personal Projects

**Caspir Camera** - [check it out on the App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/)!

CaspirCam is a ios photography app that I built to help people take better photos. Caspir Cam enables users to copy the location, posing, and composition of images from templates by pro photographers and CaspirCam influencers. Built with Swift.


**RedViz** - [https://grace-raper.github.io/redviz/](https://grace-raper.github.io/redviz/)

RedViz is a data vizualization project that allows viewers to better understand the lasting impacts of redlining by exploring and interact with modern day data in the context of historical HOLC maps.

##  üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Additional Experiences
**Vice President I - Coordinator of Committees** @ [Zeta Tau Alpha](https://zetataualpha.org) _(October 2020 - December 2021)_ <br>
* Managed a ~$50k budget for the Programs Council, distributing funds between events, negotiating vendor contracts, creating risk reduction plans, and ensuring expenses were within budget.
* Oversaw development of 30 Programs Council members, providing training, support, and mentorship to foster leadership skills and personal growth.
* Served as the liaison between the Executive Council and Programs Council, delivering regular updates and ensuring a diverse and engaging calendar of events that aligned with the chapter and organization goals, while targeting the needs and desires of our 100+ members. As a result, we achieved a 95% member retention rate.

**Math and Computer Science Tutor** @ [GoPeer](https://gopeer.org) _(March 2020 - March 2021)_ <br>
* Delivered one-on-one math and computer science tutoring to over 20 high school students, resulting in an average increase of 2 letter grades in their coursework.
* Developed personalized project-based curriculums for each student, tailored to their individual learning needs, resulting in a 98% client satisfaction rating.
